The latest official Atari Hard Drive Utilities. (v5.00, Dec. 3, 1991)
Included are:

HDX v5.00 - More compatible command set, should be able to format
just about any drive you throw at it, including drives such as the
Quantum "PULSE" drives. (WINCAP is now only required for ST506/412
drives or SCSI drives connected through ACSI that HDX cannot determine
through the "mode sense" commands, such as a Quantum 210s, due to the
fact that the "Inquire Capacity" command uses all 8 bits of the
command byte)

AHDI/SHDRIVER v5.00 - Support for SCSI, ACSI, and IDE all rolled into
one; also has the ability to scan all devices instead of continuing
boot after no response from a unit (allows for non-contiguous devices
numbers); displays drive information during boot-up.

A version of the driver with the configuration bits set for
non-contiguous devices and any-size Syquest cartridges is in the
folder "ALLDRIVE" (which allows you to boot with no cart in the drive
and be able to insert a 1 to 4 partition cart at anytime and read it,
although the system will always reserve four drive letters for the
removeable drives).

Please use HINSTALL to install the new driver; _after_ the new driver
is installed, you may copy the SHDRIVER.SYS from the \ALLDRIVE\
folder to your boot drive and overwrite the installed one.

AHDI/SHDRIVER DOES NOT SUPPORT THE ICD/SUPRA EXTENDED PARTITIONING
SCHEME.
